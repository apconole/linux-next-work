/*
 * HMM provides helpers to help leverage heterogeneous memory ie memory with
 * differents characteristics (latency, bandwidth, ...). The core idea is to
 * migrate virtual address range of a process to different memory. HMM is not
 * involve in policy or decision making of what memory and where to migrate.
 * HMM only provides helpers for the grunt work of migrating memory.
 *
 * Second part of HMM is to provide helpers to mirror a process address space
 * on a device. Here it is about mirroring CPU page table inside device page
 * table and making sure that they keep pointing to same memory for any given
 * virtual address. Bonus feature is allowing migration to device memory that
 * can not be access by CPU.
